# Topolearn

This project implements a selection of fundamental algorithms used in topological data analysis. The purpose is  educational, for most use cases there are more optimised and tested libraries. I have aimed to keep the implementations simple and compact to highlight the algorithms. The library is written  in python only, and relies on numpy, scipy and scikit-learn for the heavy lifting.

The implemented algorithms include

* Graph learning algorithms
    * Self Organising Maps
    * Growing Neural Gas
    * Generative Gaussian Graphs
    * Mapper 
* Persistent homology
    * Vietoris-Rips Complex
    * Alpha Complex
    * Matrix reduction for finding birth-death pairs
    * Persistence images
    * Persistence landscapes
* Toplogical loss 
    * Topological loss function for autoencoders
  
See the example notebooks for more information.
